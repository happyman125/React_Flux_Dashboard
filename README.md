# Dashboard
Weather and Google calendar dashboard built with [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) &amp; [Flux](https://facebook.github.io/flux/)

[![Build Status](https://drone.io/github.com/danesparza/Dashboard/status.png)](https://drone.io/github.com/danesparza/Dashboard/latest)

*To build, make sure you have the latest version of [Node](https://nodejs.org/) installed.  Node isn't used for anything more than [package management](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/npm) and to ease local development.  If you've never used Node before, it's a quick install and [there are installers for multiple platforms](https://nodejs.org/download/), including Windows, Linux and OSX.*

### Quick Start

After [cloning the repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fetching-a-remote/), run the following commands in the project directory to get the required Javascript package dependencies and build the `bundle.js` file:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

This will also watch your local system for any changes.  If you make changes to any referenced components, the `bundle.js` file will automatically be rebuilt.
